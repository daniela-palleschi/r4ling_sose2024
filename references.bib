This technology is the basis of the present review aim at providing information about groups of benevolent microorganisms such as: lactic acid bacteria, photo- trophic bacteria, actinomycetes group, yeast group and fungi present in natural ecosystems which are physiologically compatible with each other. Efficient Microorganisms, as a microbial inoculantion, resto- re soil microbiological balance, improve its physical and chemical conditions, increase crop production and protection, preserve natural resources, and ge- nerate a more sustainable agriculture and environ- ment. They can be used in the livestock (cattle, por- ciculture and poultry) for animal husbandry and the increase of productive variables. All this maximizes the efficiency of the systems and the management of excreta and facilities.},

  abstract = {The ability to think about nonpresent time is a crucial aspect of human cognition. Both the past and future imply a temporal displacement of an event outside the ``now.'' They also intrinsically differ: The past refers to inalterable events; the future to alterable events, to possible worlds. Are the past and future processed similarly or differently? In this study, we addressed this question by investigating how Spanish speakers process past/future time reference violations during sentence processing, while recording eye movements. We also investigated the role of verbs (in isolation; within sentences) and adverbs (deictic; nondeictic) during time processing. Existing accounts propose that past processing, which requires a link to discourse, is more complex than future processing, which{\textemdash}like the present{\textemdash}is locally bound. Our findings show that past and future processing differs, especially at early stages of verb processing, but this difference is not limited to the presence/absence of discourse linking. We found earlier mismatch effects for past compared to future time reference in incongruous sentences, in line with previous studies. Interestingly, it took longer to categorize the past than the future tense when verbs were presented in isolation. However, it took longer to categorize the future than the past when verbs were presented in congruous sentences, arguably because the future implies alterable worlds. Finally, temporal adverbs were found to play an important role in reinspection and reanalysis triggered by the presence of undefined time frames (nondeictic adverbs) or incongruences (mismatching verbs).},

  abstract = {In addition to benefiting reproducibility and transparency, one of the advantages of using R is that researchers have a much larger range of fully customizable data visualizations options than are typically available in point-and-click software because of the open-source nature of R. These visualization options not only look attractive but also can increase transparency about the distribution of the underlying data rather than relying on commonly used visualizations of aggregations, such as bar charts of means. In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to data visualization using R specifically aimed at researchers who have little to no prior experience of using R. First, we detail the rationale for using R for data visualization and introduce the ``grammar of graphics'' that underlies data visualization using the ggplot package. The tutorial then walks the reader through how to replicate plots that are commonly available in pointand-click software, such as histograms and box plots, and shows how the code for these ``basic'' plots can be easily extended to less commonly available options, such as violin box plots. The data set and code used in this tutorial and an interactive version with activity solutions, additional resources, and advanced plotting options are available at https:// osf.io/bj83f/.},
